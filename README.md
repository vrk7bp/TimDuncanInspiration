TimDuncanInspiration
====================

This is just a fun little project that I worked on to get more acquainted with the SendGrid and Google Custom Search APIs. This ~100 line program simply sends a new e-mail with a picture of Tim Duncan and a random quote to everyone I have on a list every morning. As of right now, the program works perfectly and stays within my API limit for both the Google Custom Search and Sendgrid API. However I still have a bit more testing to do on the e-mail format side to make sure that it atleast looks nice. Then I will simply set this up as a CRON job on an AWS instance and be good to go.

Overall this was a fun project that didn't take more than 2 or 3 hours to make. I will soon add a link to my website for anyone who wants to be added to the e-mail list.
